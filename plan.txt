liking is a problem because when i upvote and change page, it takes a while to get if ive likes the post or not. I need 
to only make the call once and place in local storage. if it changes, just change the local storage too so we dont have to grab 
it from the server everytime.✅

now the post ive upvoted/downvoted are retrieved quick because they are in local storage so dont have to be fetched. Our problem now is
that it takes time to retrieve the amount of likes a post has, there is a big delay. To fix this problem i need to
handle the liking in the front end as well as the backend. in the front end, i can check if its upvoted/downvoted. From this i can
justify what the likes should be.

new problem. when i like it takes time to reload the data. what i need to do is change confessions so that all confessions are preloaded straight away.
this way when i change between pages, there is no fetching from server as its already done, so no wait time.✅
